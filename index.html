						<h2>
							Machine Learning (ML)
						</h2>
						<h4>ML is a branch of artificial intelligence:
						</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Uses computing based systems to make sense out of data Extracting patterns, fitting data to functions, classifying data, etc
							</li>
							<li>
								ML systems can learn and improve with historical data, time and experience
							</li>
						</ul>

						<h4>
							Machine learning can be classified into 3 types of algorithms.
						</h4>
						<ul>
							<li>Supervised Learning</li>
							<li>Unsupervised Learning</li>
							<li>Reinforcement Learning</li>
						</ul>

						<h3>
							Overview of Supervised Learning Algorithm
						</h3>
						<h4>In Supervised learning, an AI system is presented with data which is labeled, which means that each data tagged with the correct label.</h4>

					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>
							Types of Supervised learning
						</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Classification: A classification problem is when the output variable is a category, such as “red” or “blue” or “disease” and “no disease”.</li>
							<li>Regression: A regression problem is when the output variable is a real value, such as “dollars” or “weight”.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>
							Overview of Unsupervised Learning Algorithm
						</h3>
						<p>In unsupervised learning, an AI system is presented with unlabeled, uncategorized data and the system’s algorithms act on the data without prior training. </p>
						<img src="./assets/unsupervised.png" alt="">
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>
							Types of Unsupervised learning
						</h3>
						<ul>
							<li>Clustering: A clustering problem is where you want to discover the inherent groupings in the data, such as grouping customers by purchasing behavior.</li>
							<li>Association: An association rule learning problem is where you want to discover rules that describe large portions of your data, such as people that buy X also tend to buy Y.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>
							Overview of Reinforcement Learning
						</h3>
						<h4>A reinforcement learning algorithm, or agent, learns by interacting with its environment. </h4>

						Summary

					<h4>I have presented you with the basics concepts of Machine learning and I hope this presentation was helpful and would have motivated you enough to get interested in the topic.</h4>
